# Licenses

See [LICENSE]() for the real license.
This is a simplified version.

There are two licences that cover the various Amulet codebases.
1) The Amulet Map Editor License
2) The Amulet Library License

The former applies to the code that makes up the user interface (this repository) and the bundled form of the program and the latter applies to a number of libraries that Amulet uses.

This summary will only cover the former. See the libraries for the latter.

## Motive
We want everyone to be able to use and contribute to Amulet, however developing the program costs money.
Pathway are currently sponsoring the project but we need to design the licence to leave open potential income sources.

## License Summary
- The program is free to use for non-commercial users.
- The program is free to use for purely educational commercial purposes.
- If your use case does not fit in the above you should chat to us about a commercial licence.
- You are allowed to modify the code however you wish and submit changes to us if you like.
- You are not allowed to redistribute our code unless explicitly licenced to allow otherwise.


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Am I allowed to use Amulet to edit my world?

You can use Amulet for free as long as:
- You are not making money using Amulet.
- You are not making money from the content made using Amulet.

### Can I make money using Amulet in an education setting?
You are allowed to use Amulet for free and make money if your usage is purely educational.

Examples of educational usage:
- Monetising videos or other materials explaining how to use Amulet.
- Earning an income from teaching how to use Amulet or using Amulet to help teach other subjects.

Any content (eg. worlds or structures) created during that time must be used solely for educational purposes and may not be sold or used in any other commercial environment.

### Can I make money using Amulet?

Commercial usage includes getting paid to use Amulet and the manufacture of content (eg. worlds or structures) that is later monetised.

If you are using Amulet in a commercial setting that does not fit into the educational exception then you should contact us about a commercial licence.

### Can I redistribute or rehost your code?
No. Unless the code is explicitly licensed to allow otherwise, you cannot redistribute or rehost any code from Amulet.

This includes the code in both source and compiled forms.

The only exception to this is forking the original repository on Github with the aim to modify or improve on the code.

Some files (such as editor operations) are released under the MIT licence to allow redistribution. These files will have the MIT licence at the top of the file.

### Can I modify any part of Amulet?
You are allowed to modify Amulet however you like.

If you want to make improvements we accept code submissions through pull requests.

### Can I make and sell plugins for Amulet?
Plugins are extensions to Amulet. 3D Editor Operations are an example of plugins for Amulet.

Operations are programs that can be run from within Amulet Map Editor in the operations tab of the 3D editor.

You are allowed to make, distribute and license your operations however you wish.

You are also allowed to make money through the sale or licensing of your operations if you wish.

Your operations can call Amulet code but may not directly include any Amulet code unless licenced to allow redistribution.
