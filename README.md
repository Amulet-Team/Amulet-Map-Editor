## Running compiled builds

Extract the contained folder to a location on your computer and run the executable.

## Running from Source

**If you are running a compiled build you do NOT need to do this.**

1) Install [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/)
2) We recommend setting up a [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) so you don't run into issues with dependency conflicts.
3) run `python -m pip install amulet-map-editor` to install the library and all its dependencies.
4) run `python amulet_map_editor` to run the program

### Notes

If you have python 2 installed `python` may point to the wrong version in which case you will have to swap out `python` for `python3`
